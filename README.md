Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
This project focuses on building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

Background
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Instructions
1. Select Test Subject ID No.
